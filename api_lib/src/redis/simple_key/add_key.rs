/**
 * Adds a key to Redis if it does not already exist.
 * This function attempts to set a key with a value in Redis using the `SETNX` command,
 *   which sets the key only if it does not already exist.
 *
 * # Arguments
 * * `conn` - A mutable reference to a Redis connection.
 * * `key` - The key to be added.
 * * `value` - The value to be associated with the key.
 *
 * # Returns
 * * `Ok(())` if the key was successfully added.
 * * `Err(redis::RedisError)` if the key already exists or if there was an error during the operation.
