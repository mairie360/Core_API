# (`sub=1`, the Admin seeded by liquibase, `role=admin`, valid 4 hours) is signed with it here,
# exactly like mairie360_api_lib::jwt_manager does (HS256, claims { sub, role, exp }). Nothing
# signed with a committed secret is left in the repository: the repos are public, so a committed
# token would be an admin token anywhere that secret was reused.

# Exports JWT_SECRET (kept when already set) and ADMIN_JWT. Needs openssl.
